# My Alacritty Configuration

This is my personal alacritty configuration.

Setup:

1. On your local machine navigate to `~/.config/`. Before running this command make sure that the `alacritty` directory has not already been created. Otherwise you can pick choose config values you want by inspecting [alacritty.toml](https://github.com/Audiosutras/My-Alacritty-Toml-Config/blob/main/alacritty.toml)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Audiosutras/My-Alacritty-Toml-Config.git alacritty
```
